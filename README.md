## Offline Mode

The app supports offline functionality using **AsyncStorage**. The list of albums and their details are cached locally, so you can access the album data even without an internet connection.

- If there is no internet connection, the app will display the cached album data.
- If an internet connection is available, the app will fetch fresh data from the iTunes API.

## Testing

The app uses **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit and integration testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
